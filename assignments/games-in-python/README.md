# 🕹️ Games in Python

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to create simple games using Python. You will practice using loops, conditionals, and functions to build interactive programs.

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: Build a Number Guessing Game
**Description:** Create a game where the computer randomly selects a number and the player tries to guess it.
**Requirements:**
- The game should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player should be prompted to guess until they get the correct answer.
- After each guess, tell the player if their guess is too high or too low.
- Display the number of attempts when the player wins.

**Example:**
```
Guess the number (1-100): 50
Too low!
Guess the number (1-100): 75
Too high!
Guess the number (1-100): 63
Correct! You guessed it in 3 tries.
```

### Task 2: Create a Simple Text Adventure
**Description:** Write a text-based adventure game with at least three rooms and choices for the player.
**Requirements:**
- Use functions to organize your code.
- Allow the player to make choices that affect the outcome.
- Include at least one win and one lose condition.

**Example:**
```
You are in a dark room. There is a door to your left and right.
Which one do you take? (left/right): left
You find a treasure chest! You win!
```
